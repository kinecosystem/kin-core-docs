### What is Kin?

Kin is a cryptocurrency with a mission to compensate everyone fairly for their contributions.
It creates a new way for big and small businesses, apps, networks, and digital services to monetize
by encouraging and facilitating value creation.
By integrating Kin with your service, be it an multiplayer video game, an online community, or any other digital service,
businesses can compensate their users for the value they’re bringing and the contributions they’re making.

### What is this website?

This website has technical documentation for the Kin SDK.
The SDK allows developers to add support for sending and receiving KIN in an app, community, or digital service.

It's goal is to abstract complexities surrounding blockchain technologies,
and let developers focus on building a great product without worrying too much on the underlying layers.
An example of some abstractions that the SDK takes care of are:
Which blockchain network is being used, Account funding, Fee management, Cryptographic seed creation, Establishing token trustlines, and more.
